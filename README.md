## Dependly

`npm install` or `yarn install` is necessary for test to work.

Please use command `yarn start` or `npm start` to see the outputs.

Modifying files `INPUT1.txt` or `INPUT3.txt` in `src/input_files/` folder can be done for checking different library relations correctness.

More files with correct format can be dropped in `src/input_files/` directory. Files in this directory will be auto read.

#### Test

Please use `yarn test` command to run tests.

- `INPUT2.txt` file is being used for test. Editing contents here will result if test failure.
- `INPUT1.txt`, `INPUT2.txt` & `INPUT3.txt` files are mandatory for test to pass.
- Contents in `INPUT1.txt` & `INPUT3.txt` can be altered.

Thank you.
