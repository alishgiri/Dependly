## Dependly

`npm install` or `yarn install` is not necessary.

Please use command `yarn start` or `npm start` to see the outputs.

Modify `src/input_files/INPUT*.txt` files for different library relations.

Or add more files on `src/input_files/` directory. Files in this directory will be auto read.

Thank you.
